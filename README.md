# Public API Data Gathering 

Objectives:
This project focuses on achieving the following objectives:

Retrieve data from a public API: Utilize a public API to gather relevant data for analysis and processing within the project scope.

Manipulate nested data structures: JSON: Handle and manipulate nested data structures, particularly JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), which is commonly used in APIs for data exchange.

Use Python lists and dictionaries: Employ Python lists and dictionaries effectively to organize and manipulate data retrieved from the API.

Make Python functions: Implement modular and reusable code by creating Python functions that encapsulate specific tasks or operations related to data retrieval and manipulation.

Project Overview:

The project involves accessing a public API to retrieve data, which is then processed and manipulated using Python. The data retrieved may be nested in JSON format, requiring parsing and extraction of relevant information. Python lists and dictionaries are used to store and organize the retrieved data, enabling further analysis or presentation as needed. Additionally, functions are implemented to streamline the data retrieval and manipulation processes
